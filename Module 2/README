Description:

Filtering is the fundamental operation in image and video processing.

Edge-preserving smoothing filters are used in different applications.

The most popular filters in this class are anisotropic diffusion and the bilateral filter.

Anisotropic diffusion requires an iterative solver while bilateral filtering uses  a space-varying weighting function computed at a space of higher dimensionality than the signal being filtered. As a result, such filters have high computational costs.

The technique implemented here efficiently performs edge-preserving filtering of images and videos that addresses the main limitations of previous techniques.

This technique efficiently implements 2D edge-preserving smoothing filters as a sequence of 1D filtering operations. The resulting 2D filters correctly handlecolor images.

Its processing time is also linear in the number of pixels and is independent of the filter parameters, allowing for realtime computations.

Enter Image: images/statue.png

sigma_s(default val: 60): 60
sigma_r(default val: .45): .45

Output: Smoothened Image

sigma_s and sigma_r are gaussian spatial and range filter values.
