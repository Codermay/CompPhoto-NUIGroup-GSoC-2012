Decolorization is the process to transform a color image to a grayscale image. It is a basic tool in digital printing, stylized black-and-white photography, and in many single channel image processing applications.

Grayscale is one of the widely used pictorial expressions in digital printing and photograph rendering. Color-to-gray conversion is required in many single-channel image processing applications. Naturally, this type of conversion is a task of dimension reduction, which inevitably suffers from information loss. The general goal is thus to use the limited range in gray scales to preserve as much as possible the original color contrast.
