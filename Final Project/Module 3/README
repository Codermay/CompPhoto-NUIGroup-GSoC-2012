Description:

Decolorization is the process to transform a color image to a grayscale image. It is a basic tool in digital printing, stylized black-and-white photography, and in many single channel image processing applications.

Grayscale is one of the widely used pictorial expressions in digital printing and photograph rendering. Color-to-gray conversion is required in many single-channel image processing applications. Naturally, this type of conversion is a task of dimension reduction, which inevitably suffers from information loss. The general goal is thus to use the limited range in gray scales to preserve as much as possible the original color contrast.

This code has been written in C++ using OpenCV library. It has been tested on Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit linux platform.

Compile: ./build.sh
(Make sure that OpenCV-2.4 is installed on your platform)

Usage: ./decolor

Example Output:

 Color2Gray Filter
-------------------

Enter Color Image: image.jpg

Output: Contrast Preserved Gray Image, OpenCV Gray Image and Contrast Boost Image
