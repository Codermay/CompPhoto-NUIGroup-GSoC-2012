Description:

Filtering is the fundamental operation in image and video processing.

Edge-preserving smoothing filters are used in different applications.

The most popular filters in this class are anisotropic diffusion and the bilateral filter.

Anisotropic diffusion requires an iterative solver while bilateral filtering uses  a space-varying weighting function computed at a space of higher dimensionality than the signal being filtered. As a result, such filters have high computational costs.

The technique implemented here efficiently performs edge-preserving filtering of images and videos that addresses the main limitations of previous techniques.

This technique efficiently implements 2D edge-preserving smoothing filters as a sequence of 1D filtering operations. The resulting 2D filters correctly handlecolor images.

Its processing time is also linear in the number of pixels and is independent of the filter parameters, allowing for realtime computations.

Techniques:

1) Edge Preserve Smoothing

Smoothing of image while preserving edge details.

Usage:
Press 1 for Normalized Convolution Filter and 2 for Recursive Filter: 1

Enter Image: image.jpg

sigma_s(default val: 60): 60
sigma_r(default val: .45): .45

Output: Smoothened Image

2) Detail Enhancement

Detail Manipulation Edge-preserving filters can be used to decompose image details into several scales, which can be manipulated independently and recombined to produce various effects. This filter basically enhances the details of a particular image.

Usage:
Enter Image: image.jpg

sigma_s(default val: 10): 10
sigma_r(default val: .15): .15
Scale Factor(default val: 3): 3 (ranges from 1 to 4)

Output: Detail Enhanced Image

3) Pencil sketch/Color Pencil Drawing

This produces a pencil-like non-photorealistic drawing.

Usage:
Enter Image: image.jpg

sigma_s(default val: 60): 60
sigma_r(default val: .07): .07
Shade_Factor(Range: .01 to .1): .04 (.01 denotes dark sketch while .1 denotes light sketch)

Output: Pencil sketch Image

4) Stylization

Stylization aims to produce digital imagery with a wide variety of effects not focused on photorealism. Edge-aware filters are ideal for stylization, as they can abstract regions of lowcontrast while preserving, or enhancing, high-contrast features.

Usage:
Enter Image: image.jpg

sigma_s(default val: 60): 60
sigma_r(default val: .45): .4

Output: Stylized Image

5) Clip-Art Compression Artifact Removal

The edge preserve smoothing method is also advantageous for cartoon/clip-art compression artifact removal.

Usage:
Enter Image: clip_art_artifact_image.jpg

sigma_s(default val: 60): 60
sigma_r(default val: .45): .4

Output: Artifact Removed Image

6) Depth of Field

This is an example of joint filtering where the content of one image is smoothed based on the edge information from a second image. The resulting filter produces a unique stylized depth-of-field effect.

Usage:
Enter Image: image.jpg
Enter Joint Image: joint_image.jpg

sigma_s(default val: 20): 20
sigma_r(default val: .2): .2

Output: Depth-of-Field Image

7) Edge Enhancement

Edge extraction from natural images is a basic manipulation filter. Structured edges can be used for natural image editing and high-level structure inference. High quality results that are continuous, accurate, and thin are generally very difficult to produce due to high susceptibility of edge detectors to complex structures and inevitable noise. This method is able to suppress low-amplitude details and enhance edges.

Usage: 
Enter Image: image.jpg

sigma_s(default val: 60): 60
sigma_r(default val: .3): .3

Output: Edge Enhanced Image

Press number 1-7 to choose from above techniques: 1

Press 1 for Normalized Convolution Filter and 2 for Recursive Filter: 1

Enter Image: image.jpg

sigma_s(default val: 60): 60
sigma_r(default val: .45): .45

sigma_s and sigma_r are gaussian spatial and range filter values.
