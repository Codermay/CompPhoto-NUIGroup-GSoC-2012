This code has been written in C++ using OpenCV library. It has been tested on Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit linux platform.

Compile: ./build.sh
(Make sure that OpenCV-2.4 is installed on your platform)

Usage: ./poisson <source image> <destination image>

Input:
-> Source Image
-> Destination Image

Output:
-> Cloned Image

Selecting Region of Interest (ROI):

Step 1:
-> In the source image, select the region of interest by left click mouse button. A rectangular ROI will be created.
-> To reset the region selected, right click mouse button.

Step 2:
-> In the destination image, select the ROI where you want to place in the image by left clicking mouse button.
-> To get the cloned result, click the right mouse button.

Description:

Mixed seamless cloning based on a loose selection proves effective when inserting objects with holes.

Mixed seamless cloning facilitates the transfer of partly transparent objects.
The non-linear mixing of gradient fields picks out whichever of source or destination structure is the more salient at each location.

This mixed seamless cloning is also useful when adding one object from a source image very close to another object in the destination image.
