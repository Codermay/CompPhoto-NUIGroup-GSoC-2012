This code has been written in C++ using OpenCV library. It has been tested on Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit linux platform.

Compile: ./build.sh
(Make sure that OpenCV-2.4 is installed on your platform)

Usage: ./clone <source image> <destination image>

Input:
-> Source Image
-> Destination Image

Output:
-> Cloned Image

Selecting Region of Interest (ROI):

Step 1:
-> In the source image, select the region of interest by pressing left mouse button. A rectangular ROI will be created.
-> To reset the region selected, press right mouse button.

Step 2:
-> In the destination image, select the ROI where you want to place in the image by pressing left mouse button.
-> To get the cloned result, press the right mouse button.

NOTE:

Poisson Image Editing is a technique for "seamlessly blending" two images together fully automatically.
The algorithm assumes that the color of the source image is close to that of the target. 
This assumption means that when the colors don't match, the source image color gets tinted 
toward the color of the target image.
